Hello community, if u could pass on any ideas for this project (web app with js and html css) or may want to collaborate with me as junior developer are welcome to contribute ideas.

First want to build a prototyping  may be python. The raw ideas are covering these topics ::

Types of Controls:
Control Group:
A group that does not receive the experimental treatment or intervention, serving as a baseline for comparison with the experimental group. 
Positive Control:
A sample that is known to produce a positive result, confirming that the experimental setup can detect the expected outcome. 
Negative Control:
A sample that is not expected to produce a change, ensuring the absence of an effect when it's not anticipated. 
Placebo Control:
In studies involving humans, a placebo (a fake treatment) is used to control for psychological effects. 
Vehicle Control:
Used when a substance is dissolved in a solution, this control tests the effect of the solution alone. 

Core app fn= For streamlining research paper submission automation.
